Witness Statement - 2023-10-27
Witness Name: Sarah Jenkins

"I was walking my dog near the First National Bank on 4th Street around 2:00 PM. I heard a loud screeching noise and saw a red car speeding away from the bank's parking lot. It looked like a sports car, maybe a Mustang or a Camaro. The driver was wearing a dark hoodie, and I couldn't see their face. The car turned right onto Oak Avenue and disappeared."
