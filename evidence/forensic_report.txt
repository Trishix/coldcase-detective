Forensic Report - Case #49281
Date: 2023-10-28
Analyst: Dr. Aris Thorne

Evidence Analyzed: Tire marks found at the scene (First National Bank parking lot).

Analysis:
The tire tread pattern found at the scene matches the "SpeedMaster Pro" series tires, commonly used on high-performance sports coupes.
Specifically, the width and groove pattern suggest a 2022 or 2023 model year vehicle.
Residue analysis of the tire marks indicates high-speed acceleration.
No paint chips were recovered from the scene.
Latent prints recovered from the bank's door handle were inconclusive.
